# Project Title

## Description

This project is a Java program that reads the content of a text file named "text.txt" and prints it to the console. It then splits the content into an ArrayList of words using the space character as a delimiter. The program then prints the ArrayList, the number of words in the ArrayList, and the number of characters in the ArrayList as a string.
